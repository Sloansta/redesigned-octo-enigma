# redesigned-octo-enigma
Proof of concept for a new fullstack project that I will be building from scratch

# Possible ideas: 

## Twitter but with no character limit 
* Like twitter but a platform for articles that are generated by users for other users to read.
* Potentially a mix between medium and twitter, but more so in the middle. Needs to feel like the user is reading a good opinion piece, rather than them knowing they are endlessly scrolling like with twitter.
* Posts could be tagged, but rather than '#' like how twitter does it, more of a tagging system like how tags work on Github, so that users can search by topic and not buzzword. 
* Limited number of tags or unlimited user generated tags? 
* If tags are limited, perhaps adding sub tags to get the hashtag feel?
* Like button, share button and comment button are a must. 
* Potential comment threading like twitter or just stacks of comments? 
* Dislike button? If this gains any sort of track, there is obviously going to be some bad takes written. 
* Could be a learning experience to work with React Native. That might be cool.
* Maybe use something like ChakraUI for the front-end? 
* On the same note, we don't want to over complicate things from the start, might just be easier writting everything in tailwind for MVP.
* I really want to work with React Native.... But do we HAVE to? It's not a must. 
* If React Native isn't worked with, I could always implement it after MVP.
